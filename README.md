## Data set

We measured the sensitivities of two non-malignant breast cell lines and 33 breast cancer cell lines of which twenty were triple negative, six were hormone receptor positive, four were Her2 amplified, and three were established from triple negative patient-derived xenografts to 34 clinically-relevant small molecule perturbagens. A microscopy-based dose response assay was used to measure drug potency, and to quantify drug efficacy in terms of growth inhibition (GR metrics) and cell death. We treated cells with single drugs over a 9-point ½ log dilution series from a maximum dose not exceeding 10 µM and then measured cell number and viability after three days of drug exposure.
